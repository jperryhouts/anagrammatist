Anagrammatist
=============

Requires wxpython.

Anagrammatist is a simple tool to assist in coming up with
subversive slogans for replacing messages on marquee signs.
It is intended for finding amusing rearrangements of letters,
given a finite number of initial letters.

There is no limit on the length of the anagram, as is the case
with many similar applications.
