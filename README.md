Anagrammatist
=============

Anagrammatist is a simple tool to assist in coming up with
subversive slogans for replacing messages on marquee signs.
It is intended for finding amusing rearrangements of letters,
given a finite number of initial letters. Anagrammatist
encourages creative use of similar-looking letters. For example,
it will suggest words which contain W's even if the original
text only contained M's.

There is no limit on the length of the anagram, as is the case
with many similar applications.
